    <p>
    <b>Note:</b> This is a personal project of
    my own; I believe/assume this is an
    original work and similar work has not been
    carried out by anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
    It seesm most people want to know what this
    used for; this is a comment I wrote in
    reddit
    </p>
    <p style="background-color:#B6ACAC">
    <i style="color:white">"I try to explain
    with a little example say we need to
    predict Partition coefficient of a chemical
    molecule. A partition coefficient(P) or Log
    P can take any real values both positive or
    negative eg: Acetamide= -1.16. If we want
    to predict such values for a chemical
    molecule in neural network then we have to
    use linear activation function as last
    layer and need to train it in a regression
    way, which may or may not succeed.<br/>
    My idea is to avoid this step and predict
    real numbers as binary classification with
    a certain length. As a proof of my idea I
    made a auto encoder which was able to get a
    fair good but not the best predictions"</i>

    There are two ways, that I know of, to
    generate real numbers using neural networks
    and those are the regression and seq2seq
    approaches. From experience I can say that
    both regression and recurrent(seq2seq)
    methods are computationally heavy and I
    also assume the transformer(seq2seq)
    technique may also need more computation.
    In this project my goal was to generate
    real numbers using classification only
    approach with a simple neural network. The
    advantages of such method will be fast
    training and quick prediciton of outputs.
    An another novel application for this is
    building a neural network enabled
    calculator for deterministic real number
    operations.

    <h2>
    Real to Vectors.
    </h2>
    <p>
    Real number in its real form cannot be used
    for a classification method. We need to
    convert real numbers to a binary vector
    form. First we need to separate real
    numbers into its three corresponding
    <b>Sign</b>, <b>Integers</b> and
    <b>Decimal/Placeholder</b> parts. An
    example for such breakup can be seen in the
    below image.

    <img alt="real_example" src="images/real_example.jpg"
    style="width:288px;height:235px;"/>
    </center><br/>
    The sign determining value $k$ can be found
    by<br/>
    <br/>
    <center>
    $k = argmax(softmax(\mathbb{R}^{2}))$
    </center><br/>
    For integers we need to first find the matching
    vector $\mathbf{i}$. The vector can then be
    transformed to a scalar $i$ by taking dot
    product with vector having list of values which
    are powers of 10. Here $d$ is the maximum
    integer length.<br/>
    <br/>
    <center>
    $\mathbf{i} =
    argmax_{row}(softmax_{row}(\mathbb{R}^{d
    \times10}))$
    </center><br/>
    <center>
    $i = \mathbf{i} \cdot [10^{d..0} ]$
    </center><br/>
    The decimal's placeholder value $p$ which
    determines where the decimal should be placed
    in the integers can be obtained by<br/>
    <br/>
    <center>
    $p = argmax(softmax(\mathbb{R}^{d}))$
    </center><br/>
    In the end real numbers can be calculated using
    the formula.<br/>
    <br/>
    <center>
    $\mathbb{R}= \left \{ (-1)^{k}\times i
    \times10^{-p} \right \}$

    <h2>
    Neural Network.
    </h2>
    <p>
    A linear neural network was used for this
    project but any other varieties of neural
    network will also work. Because my primary
    aim was to validate my idea I had used a
    autoencoder model to generate real numbers.
    The autoencoder model has three input heads
    and three output heads.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>
            Input Heads: Sign, Integers,
            Decimal
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
            Output Heads: Sign, Integers,
            Decimal
        </p>
    </li>
    </ul>The loss function used was a binary
    crossentropy loss for the three output heads
    plus a custom <b>difference loss</b> function.
    The difference loss function finds the
    difference between our target and output
    integers. This loss function in its current
    form is a non differentiable since it have
    argmax's in its computation. I was planning to
    make differentiable version of this loss
    function with softargmax but was not able to
    find a good implementation for the same in
    pytorch.

    The outputs are very encouraging and neural
    network was able to predict majoririty of
    real numbers correctly. Loss function
    corresponding to Sign and Decimal output
    heads were optimized properly. But In my
    option the stochasticity of generated real
    numbers was due to the sub optimal loss
    functions used for integers head. A much
    more improved integer head loss function
    might increase the accuracy of prediction.
    Overfitting the model also helped to attain
    good predicitons, adding dropouts
    significantly affected the output results.
