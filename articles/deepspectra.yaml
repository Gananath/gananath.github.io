    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        I used to work with scientific spectral data and thought of applying
        machine learning in these data. In this project I have taken powder xrd
         spectral data to classify it into seven crystal systems. The powder
         xrd spectrum has two main sequence a 2theta angle in x axis and
         intensity in y axis. I converted this sequence data into a tensor data
          to pass it as an image format in a convolution model. This
          classification is similar to other CNN image classification except
          instead of passing colour channels as depth here we are passing
          feature vectors. Number of matrix in the created tensor represents
          the number of features of the sequence. The possible application is
          classifiction of uv,ir,raman spectra or protein/nucleotide analysis.

        The idea is to find spatial or temporal features (if any) from the
        sequence data and then classify it into different classes.
