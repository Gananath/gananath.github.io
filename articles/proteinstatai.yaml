    <p>
        If you are visiting here for the first time
        then I would recommend you to my earlier
        project <a href=
        "https://github.com/Gananath/DrugAI">DrugAI</a>
        before reading any further. This project
        used SMILES signature of drug molecules to
        classify an organic molecule into different
        drug families.I have reused many functions
        and codes from this earlier project to this
        one. The main difference between this
        project and earlier project is, this is a
        regression problem whereas the previous one
        is a classifiction problem.

        Similar to my earlier project I have used
        Bag of words (n-grams) <a href=
        "https://gananath.github.io/drugai.html">[Link]</a>
        for feature genration and then trained it
        in a nerual network. Here protein <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format">
        FASTA</a> sequence is used as a feature.
        The <a href=
        "ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/FASTA/pep.fa.gz">
        dataset</a> and its <a href=
        "ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/FASTA/pep.fa.gz">
        stats</a> were obtained from <a href=
        "https://www.pombase.org/downloads/protein-datasets">
        pombase</a>. Because the data were in two
        different files we have to first prepare,
        clean and save it in a CSV format before
        doing any machine learning. For data
        preparation I have used <kbd>R</kbd>
        program because its fast and easier to
        code.

        A simple multilayer perceptron is used for
        this study which was createad using keras
        module in python with a theanos backend.
        The FASTA sequence were converted to
        features and target values are normalized
        before feeding it to the neural network
        model. The model was trained for 15 epochs
        with a batch size of 200 for one cross
        validation (recommend to use 10). After
        training the project, it outputted a net
        validation loss of <b>0.0173422084428</b>
        and last validation loss of
        <b>0.0079427516942</b>.
